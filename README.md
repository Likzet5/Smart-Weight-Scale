# Smart-Weight-Scale
Branch WebSocket is using Flask-SocketIO instead of jQuery Ajax. From the little testing I've done, the load on the running Raspberry Pi is less. While visually comparing the jitter of the data from the sensor in the graph, the one using WebSocket is much smoother and more regular with every data point.
WebSocket will be considerd as main. While branch using jQuery Ajax will be saved.
